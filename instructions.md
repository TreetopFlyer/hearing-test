To make a score out of 100, with 14 thresholds, each threshold is worth 7 points.
For each threshold that is exactly the same as the answer key, give 7 points.
For each threshold that is +5 or -5dB different from the answer key, give 5 points (-2 points).
For each threshold that is +10 or -10 dB or greater different from the answer key, give 0 points (-7 points).
If any of the 14 thresholds are completed, then display "Incomplete"
Running through this, a passing score would be 70% or better and someone with all scores within +/- 5 dB will get a 72. If there are more than 4 thresholds off by +/-10, that person would not pass.
